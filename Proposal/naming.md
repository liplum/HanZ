# Naming
## Variables
The name of variable can contain alphabet, Chinese characters,
such as `num`, `数`.

However, `的` is used to access a member of an object, so it's invalid to be used in naming.

To contains any keyword, a quote mark  (`` ' ``) is required to quote the variable, like `` `它的结果` ``
