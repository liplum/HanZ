# Compiler

## Compilation Process

### Phase 1: Lexing

Lexing is the initial stage of the compilation process. It involves breaking down the source code into individual tokens, which are the language's basic building blocks. Tokens represent keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, and other meaningful elements of the language.

### Phase 2: Parsing

Parsing is the next step after lexing. It involves taking the sequence of tokens generated by the lexer and constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST captures the hierarchical structure of the code and represents its syntax and organization.

### Phase 3: Semantic Analysis

Semantic analysis is a critical phase where the AST is traversed recursively. During this phase, the compiler performs deeper analysis beyond the syntax. This includes tasks such as type checking, name resolution, scope analysis, and attaching contextual information to the AST nodes.

### Phase 4: Compiling

Compiling is the final stage of the process. Once the semantic analysis is complete and the AST is enriched with contextual information, the compiler generates target code.
