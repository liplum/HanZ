# Basic

## Identifier

The name of identifier can contain only alphabet and Chinese characters, such as `num`, `数`.

However, `的` is used to access a member of an object, so it's invalid to be used in naming.

To contains any keyword, a quote mark  (`` ' ``) is required to quote the variable, like ` '它的结果' `
